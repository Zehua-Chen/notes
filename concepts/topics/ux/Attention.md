# Overview

- Info hierarchy: Information should be grouped
  - People look for interesting things
  - People retain hierarchical information better
  - Guide attention at a high level
- **Info foraging theory**: people will follow visual and textual cues to know
  that they are on the right track
- Users have an attention like a spotlight, rather than focus on everything at
  once
- Use squint test to verify hierarchy; users should be able to tell information
  hierarchy even in the items that they are not focusing on
- **Group of information that are more "important"** will appear higher in the
  information tree: user will notice more important items first as they are
  building their tree-like mental representation

# Information Foraging Theory

- The way you display information dicatates what people will pay most attention
  to
- Display info to accomplish goals; **have to know the goals of users** to help
  them
- When the scent stops getting stronger, users will move to a different
  information source
- Caveats:
  - Use simple text as labels; some data do not need labels
  - Use familiar icons
  - Icons are useful when users don't know the name of a subject
  - Aesthetics matter

# Tools to Convey Importance

Ordered by impact

1. Conceptual grouping
   - A few high level visual groups
   - Items in group are related
   - Visually distinct
2. Location: top and left are more important
3. Whitespace helps separate groups
   - Items with whitespace around them are more important
4. Size: bigger elements are more important
5. Image: items above graphics appear more important
6. Contrast: the thing that stands out is more important
7. Color
   - Not used often
   - Easily abused
   - Use color last

# Caveats

- Obvious data don't need labels
- Use familiar icons
- Icons are useful when user don't know the word for subjects
- Aestheitcs matter to finding the information
