# Accessibility

## Visual

- Headers should descend logically and should be used for section headers
- Use Accessible Rich Internet Applications (ARIA); aria roles provide reader
  users with more info, context and greater interactivity; making sure people
  can perceive content
- Alt tags: help users understand what they are unable to perceive or interact
  with particularly if they have low or no vision
- Forms:
  - HTML: use `for` attribute to indicate which `<input>` the `<label>` is for
- Spacing: don't use pixels; use relative units

## Audio

- Add subtitles: add subtitles to videos
  - HTML: `<track>`

## Physical

- Add keyboard only navigation for those unable to use a mouse
- Set visible keyboard focus

## Cognitive

- Clear icon
- Autocomplete

## Situational Disability

Disability is not a property of a person, but a property of a system.

It reflects the interaction between features of a personâ€™s body and features of
the society in which he or she lives.

- Only using one hand
- Distracted (riding a bike)
- Wearing a long coat
- Diminished hearing

## Principles of Inclusie Design

- Recognize exclusion
- Learn from diveristy
- Solve for one, extend to many

# Design for the Average

## Pros

- Only have to design one system; faster
- Maybe you can model after yourself: fewer test users
- Almost always cheaper

## Cons

- Limit who can use your system
- Might not be perfect for everyone
- Might make incorrect assumptions
- Might never learn how to design for others
