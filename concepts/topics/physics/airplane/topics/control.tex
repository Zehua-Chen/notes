\section{Control}

Use torque forces to implement pitch, roll and yall

\begin{itemize}
  \item If torques are multiplied by some value derived from the speed, then
  one can create the illusion that airplane cannot pitch, roll or yall
  when they are not moving
\end{itemize}

After yaw, pitch and roll are applied, make sure to slerp the direction of
movement to the forward direction of the plane so that movement and
control matches. Otherwise, the direction of movement would be out of sync
with the direction of the plane.

\subsection{Banking Effect}

  When an airplane rolls, it would turn to the left and right

  \begin{itemize}
    \item This can be done using the roll angle
  \end{itemize}

\subsection{Direction}

  To make sure the airplane points into the correct direction:

  \begin{itemize}
    \item Slerp the plane's current rotation to the look rotation of
    the direction of movement
  \end{itemize}
