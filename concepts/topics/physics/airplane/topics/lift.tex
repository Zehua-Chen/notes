\section{Lift}

Lift is generated because of Bernouli's principal (i.e. difference in pressure)

\begin{itemize}
  \item Top side has lower pressure
  \item Bottom side has higher pressure
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Angle of Attack}

  Angle of attack is the angle between the direction of movement, and the
  chord lines of the wings.

  \begin{itemize}
    \item If the angle is too great, then the lift produced by the wings
    would be decreased
    \item Don't actually need the angle, dot product would also do
  \end{itemize}

\subsection{Game Equation}

  This equation is intended to be used in video games

  \begin{align}
    L &= \frac{s}{s_{max}} \times L_{max}
  \end{align}

  \begin{itemize}
    \item $ s $: speed
    \item $ L_{max} $: max lift
  \end{itemize}
