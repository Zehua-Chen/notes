  \subsection{Sparse vs Dense Vectors}

    \paragraph{Sparse Vectors} Similar to how flags are represented using
    bits of an integer. We have a vector of zeros and a single one,
    the indexes at which the one is would represent a unique word.
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Inefficient, most numbers are zero
    \end{itemize}

    \paragraph{Dense Vectors} Assign a unique ID to each word, therefore
    a sentence can be represented as a unique strings
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Efficient
      \item Similarity between words are not expressed
    \end{itemize}

  \subsection{Word Embeddings}

    Each word is represented as a vector of floating points and the value
    of the floating points are trained, rather than manually specified.

    A word is also associated with an integer, which is used to lookup
    a specific embedding in the embeddings list
