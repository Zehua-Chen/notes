\chapter{Generative Adversarial Networks}

  \begin{itemize}
    \item Composed of two neural nets:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item One generates fake data
      \item The other one decides if the image (real and fake) it sees is fake
    \end{itemize}

    \item Can generate realistic local fatures, but gets the big picture
    wrong:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Too many eyes
      \item Wrong hands
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
