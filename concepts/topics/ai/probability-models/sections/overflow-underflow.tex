\section{Overflow and Underflow}

  \subsection{Underflow}

    Some probabilities can be very small. When you multiply the small
    probabilities, you get a probability that is even smaller, some too
    small for floating point storage

    \subsubsection{Solution}

      \begin{itemize}
        \item Apply $ \log\left( x \right) $ to all probabilities
        \item Convert \ul{multiplication to addition}
      \end{itemize}

  \subsection{Overflow}

    \begin{itemize}
      \item Words that does not appear in training gets zero probability
      \item Words thare are not common in training get probability that are
      not prepresentative
    \end{itemize}

    \subsubsection{Solution}

      Use smoothing
