\section{Overview}

  \subsection{Why Are Probability Models Needed}

    \begin{itemize}
      \item Logic based model is too hard to do and does not scale
      \item Learning models from examples has problems as well:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Data contains uncertainties, errors (Department of Computer Silence)
        \item Data maybe incomplete
        \item Data lack annotations (transcription, background context);
        annotations can also be wrong
      \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}

  \subsection{Recognizing Rail-Road Intersections}

    \begin{itemize}
      \item \textbf{Discrete random variables}
      \item Time of day
      \item Train near by
      \item Traffic light color
      \item Barrier arm (up or down)
      \item Continues random variables are beyond the scope of the class
    \end{itemize}

    \subsubsection{Probability}

      \begin{itemize}
        \item $ P(var = value) $: how often does this variable occur with this value
        \item Ex. $ P(arm = up) = 0.95 $
        \item Sometimes notations can be simplified (ex. $ P(up, morning) $)
      \end{itemize}

    \subsubsection{Smoothing}

      Takes observation and shifts probabilities onto what we have not observed
