\section{Beyes Net}

  Beyes net is usually used to capture causal structure.

  \subsection{Structure}

    \begin{itemize}
      \item Representned as a \textbf{partial ordered},
      \textbf{directed acyclic graph}
      \item A each node is associated with a probability value
      \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Non-conditinoal}: nodes without parent
        \item \textbf{Conditional}: nodes with parent have the \say{if} part
        of conditional probabilities set to its parent; \ul{represented
        as a probability table that consist of all possible values for all
        combinations of probability values from the parent}
      \end{itemize}

      \item Each node is considered as either true or false
      \item When a node has multiple parent, only one needs to be true for the
      node to be true
      \item Given $ n $ variables, max number of parent is $ m $, there are
      $ n \times 2^{m} $ parents
    \end{itemize}

  \subsection{Conditional Independence and Independence}

    \begin{itemize}
      \item Conditional independence and independence are not related
      \item Two nodes sharing the same parent are not independent
      \item Each node is conditionally independent of its ancestors,
      given its parents
      \item Nodes that are not connected to each other at all
      are independent of each other
    \end{itemize}

  \subsection{Reconstruct Joint Distribution}

    We can build the probability of any specific set of values by working
    from top to bottom

    \begin{equation}
      P\left( X_{1}, ... , X_{n} \right)
        = \prod_{k = 1}^{n} P\left( X_{k} | \parents\left( X_{k} \right) \right)
    \end{equation}

    \begin{itemize}
      \item Need to store $ P\left( X_{k} | \parents\left( X_{k} \right) \right) $
      at each node
      \item Nodes that are start at are also known as query variables
    \end{itemize}

  \subsection{Building a Bayes Net From a Joint Probability Distribution}

    \begin{enumerate}
      \item Put the variables in any order
      \item Fork $ k $ from $ 1 $ to $ n $
      \item Choose $ \parents\left( X_{k} \right) $ to contain all variables
      from $ X_{1} ... X_{k - 1} $ that $ P\left( X_{k} \right) $ depends on
      \item The output beyes net depends on the order in which we process
      the nodes
    \end{enumerate}

  \subsection{Topological Sort of Partial Order}

    Total/linear order of all the objects which respects the partial order.
    That is, a node always follows its ancestors.
    Usually there is more than one possible topological sort
    and we don't care which one is chosen.

    \subsubsection{Partial Order}

      \ul{Only some} of the elements in the collection is ordered

      \begin{itemize}
        \item Can linearize a partial order into a total order
      \end{itemize}

    \subsubsection{Totla Order}

      \ul{Everything} in the collection is orderered.

  \subsection{Inferrence}

    \subsubsection{Brute Force}

      \begin{itemize}
        \item Optimize $ P\left( \textbf{effect}, \text{causes} \right) $
      \end{itemize}

  \subsection{Inferrence Efficientcy}

    \begin{itemize}
      \item Optimized beyesnet inferrence is NP complete
    \end{itemize}

    \subsubsection{Poly Trees}

      Polynomial runtime for \textbf{polytree} graphs (graph that does not have
      cycle if you consider edeges as non-directional)

    \subsubsection{Junction Tree Algorithm}

      \begin{enumerate}
        \item Remove the directionality of the edges
        \item Add edges between nodes that are \textbf{not directly connected}
        but \textbf{statistically connected}, aka. moralization
        \item Add edges to breakup cycles
        \item Fully connected groups of nodes are then merged into single nodes
      \end{enumerate}

    \subsubsection{NP and NP Complete}

      \begin{itemize}
        \item A problem is NP if you can provide a succint answer that a
        \say{yes} is correct
        \begin{itemize}
          \item Problems in NP are widely believed to require exponentnial
          time; it is not decided if a polynomial time algorith exists
          \item A problem is NP complete if an polynomial time algorithm
          can be found
        \end{itemize}
      \end{itemize}
