\section{Uniform Cost Search}

  \begin{itemize}
    \item Base the search on the distance so far
    \item Frontier stored as a priority queue where the key is the distance so far
    \item BFS only finds the best path if all edges have the same cost
    \item \ul{Finds the best path}
    \item Only works if \ul{edges costs are well-behaved}:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item All positive
      \item All edge costs are >= b (some positive minimum lengths)
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}

  \subsection{Implementation}

    \begin{lstlisting}[style=pseudo]
g(s) = distance so far

frontier priority queue:
  based on g(s)

if we return to a state s:
  update distance g(s)
    \end{lstlisting}

    \begin{enumerate}
      \item Expand best state (state with the lowest cost so far) on frontier
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Use priority queue
      \end{itemize}

      \item Stop when goal is at the top of the priority queue;
      \item When return to a state, via better route, update the route distance;
      \item After reaching a goal state, \ul{the search would put the
      goal state back into the priority queue}; \ul{A solution is only
      returned when a goal state reaches the top of a priority queue}.
      \begin{itemize}
        \item To find the most optimal path to the goal state
      \end{itemize}
    \end{enumerate}
