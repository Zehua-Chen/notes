Start with low fidelity prototype, test and then iterate

- Refined prototypes are hard to change
- Want the user to focus on what the prototype is focusing on; polishment may
  distracts the user when the prototype is rune

TODO:

- Anything new is a risk
- Biggest risk is having an end-to-end working system
