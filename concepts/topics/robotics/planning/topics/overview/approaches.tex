\section{Approaches}

  \subsection{Situation Space}

    \begin{itemize}
      \item Each state is a complete model of the world
      \item Each action is an action that change the state of the world
    \end{itemize}

    \paragraph{Issues}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Very large branching factor
      \item Unnecessarily definite about ordering of unrelated actions
    \end{itemize}

  \subsection{Plan Space}

    \begin{itemize}
      \item Each state is an incompelte action, missing actions or ordering
      links
      \item Each edge add detail to the partial plan
      \item To modify a plan space:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Add actions
        \item Add ordering links between actions
      \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}

  \subsection{Frame Problem}

    A complete logical representation also requires
    \say{frame axioms} that specify all the predicates that an action does
    not change. We need a lot of frame axioms, so it's easy for some to be missing

    \subsubsection{Solution}

      Incorporating a default assumption that properties don't
      change unless actions explicitly change them
