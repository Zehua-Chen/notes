\section{Types of Planning}

  A deterministic plan is a sequence of actions to achieve a
  goal from a starting state.

  \subsection{Forward Planning}

    A forward planner searches in the state space from the
    initial state to a goal state.

  \subsection{Backward Planning}

    A backward planner, also known as a regression planner,
    searches backwards from the goal, where each node in
    the search space is a subgoal to be achieved.

  \subsection{Plan Space (Partial-Order) Planning}

    Start and finish are special actions:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \textbf{Start}: no preconditions, sets up information true
      at start of plan
      \item \textbf{Finish}: no effects, preconditions are what
      needs to be true at end of plan
    \end{itemize}

    \subsection{Defects}

      \paragraph{Open Precondition}
      An action (including finish) has a precondition with no
      guarantee that it will be true. To fix:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Add ordering link to an existing action
        \item Add a new action
      \end{itemize}

      \paragraph{Threat}
      Y's precondition is true at some point, but an (unordered) action, X,
      might cause not(Y). To fix:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Order X after Y
        \item Order Y after X (leaving Y with an explicitly open precondition)
      \end{itemize}
