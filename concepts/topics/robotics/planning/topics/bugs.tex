    \begin{itemize}
      \item $ d_{follow} $: \textbf{min} distance between sensed boundary and
      the goal
      \item $ d_{reach} < d_{follow} $: when the boundary leads the robot
      farther away from the goal
      \begin{itemize}
        \item To determine where this happen, draw a circle with goal as
        the center, and with $ d_{follow} $ as the radius
      \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
