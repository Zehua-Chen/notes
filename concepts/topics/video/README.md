# Overview

- Conceptually, videoes are made of a sequence of images, i.e. frames
- Practically, many video format only store the delta between frames to save
  space

# Bit Rate

Bit rate is how many bits are in one second of video.

- Higher the bit rate, better the image quality, more storage required
- Once bit rate advanced beyond a point, increase in image quality become less
  noticable

## Tools

- HandBrake

# Formats

- HEVC: requires specialized hardware
