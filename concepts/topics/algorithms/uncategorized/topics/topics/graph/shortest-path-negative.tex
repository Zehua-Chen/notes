\section{Shortest Path with Negative Lengths}

\begin{itemize}
  \item An efficient algorithm to find a shortest path in a graph with
  negative edge lengths, gives an efficient algorithm to find the longest
  path in a graph with positive edge lengths
  \item \textbf{Negative Length Cycle}: a cycle is negative length cycle
  if the sum of the edges are negative
  \item Undirected cases do not reduce to directed when lengths can be negative
\end{itemize}
