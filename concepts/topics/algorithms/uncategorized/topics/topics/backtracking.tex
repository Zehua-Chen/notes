\chapter{Backtracking}

Backtracking algorithms buidls up the solution to a problem incrementally and
involves some kind of decision making

\begin{itemize}
  \item In each recursive calls, we make exactly one decision
\end{itemize}

To design a backtracking algorithm

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Define recursive problems
  \item Solve the problem by using \textbf{recursive brute force}
\end{enumerate}
