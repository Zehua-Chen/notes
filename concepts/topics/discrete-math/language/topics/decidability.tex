\chapter{Decidability}

A decision problem is decidable if there is a TM that always halts that accepts
the language (language is recursive)

\begin{itemize}
  \item There is an algorithm that always answers yes or no correctly
  \item All finite languages are recursive, therefore all finite language is
  decidable
\end{itemize}
