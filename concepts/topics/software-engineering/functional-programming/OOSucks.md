[Why OO Sucks](https://www.cs.otago.ac.nz/staffpriv/ok/Joe-Hates-OO.htm)

1. **Data structures and functions are very different and should not be put into
   the same cage**;
2. **Not everything has to be an object**; They can be data types
3. **Type definition should not be everywhere**; Instead, there should be a
   small number of data types and a large number of small functions that work on
   these types
4. **Private state is bad**. States are hard to reason about, object oriented
   programming hides states, making states harder to reason about
