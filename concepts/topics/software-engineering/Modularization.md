# Modularization

[Criteria for Modularization](https://www.win.tue.nl/~wstomv/edu/2ip30/references/criteria_for_modularization.pdf)

1. Find decisions that are
   - Hard to make
   - Likely to change
2. Create modules that hide these decisions

## Example

- **Abstract Data Types** hide "decisions" on how datas are stored, how datas
  are manipulated (which can be hard)
