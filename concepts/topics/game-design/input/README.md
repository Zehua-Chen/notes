# Cloud Gaming

Cloud games suffer from big latency; reduce the need for precise controls or
short reaction time

- [Orion](https://bethesda.net/en/game/orion) is a technology that helps reduce
  latency
- [(Xbox Platform) Dynamic Latency Input](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/gaming/gdk/_content/gc/input/advanced/input-synchronization):
  **dynamically adjust report rate** of controllers so that the **controller is
  only sampled for input just before the game needs input**; without this
  technology, an input may slip by a a whole frame when playing locally, or old
  inputs may be stuck in network transit and cause the game to use inputs of
  player from much earlier in time
