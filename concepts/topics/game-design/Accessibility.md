# Overview

- **Color Blind Accessibility**: can be achieved by reducing the colors of
  similar tones and using non-color identifiers like shapes or icons.
- **Language Dependency**: A well-made icon set will also reduce
  \textbf{language dependency} and to help those with vision problems, reduce
  the amount of small text.
- **Character Diversity and Portrayal**: Unless hindered by the story, board
  games should include \textbf{a variety of characters all portrayed equally}.
- **Key Take-aways**: After reading the article, I found that accessibility
  needs to be considered in early stages of development, as the methods of
  making a board game accessible is very integrated with the overall design.
