- **Familiarity**: The theme is not a common source of unfamiliarity.
  Familiarity is usually introduced in the form of mechanics.
- **Mechanics**: that adapt a real-world counterpart, share similarities with
  popular games, or modify a familiar concept increase familiarity.
- **Avoid Creating Unfamiliarity**: Some elements of games can also introduce
  unfamiliarity. **Component**s that are too different from existing games can
  lead to unfamiliarity.
- **Language Board**: games with unique \textbf{languages} can also lead to
  unfamiliarity. % alternative to familiarity One alternative to establishing
  familiarity to gain new players is to \textbf{lower commitment}, i.e. make the
  game simple and short.
- **End Game Condition**: \textbf{End game condition} is one form of purpose.
  End game conditions can be different from objectives. For example, a game can
  have the end game condition of ten rounds but an objective of getting the most
  scores. In modern games, end game conditions and objectives are the same. For
  example, the first player to score ten points win.
- **Checkpoints**: Sometimes, objectives do not help with the immediate
  challenge that players face. \textbf{Checkpoints} can be used to help build
  purpose in these situations. Checkpoints can help players learn thought
  processes before they need them. For example, in a game of moving people to a
  destination, checkpoints can be moving people to ships that will bring them to
  the destination.
