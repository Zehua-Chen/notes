# Overview

Games, unlike movies, can be paused at anytime. Therefore, horror games need to
quickly bring players into a horror mode.

There are four levels to horror games

1. Confusion and Suspicion
2. Restricted Abilities and Choices
3. Oppression
4. Self Suggestion

## Level 1: Confusion and Suspicion

Plot of horror games are blurry at first.

- Make players wonder, and therefore at agitated
  - Ex. players has lost memory
  - Ex. players don't know what to do next and where to go next
- Let players know that they don't know the rules of the game; this is different
  from most games and should make players uncomfortable.
- Brings player to level 1: **confusion and suspicision**

## Level 2: Restricted Abilities and Choices

- Examples
  - Guns are not effective (Resident Evil)
  - Arrange backpack (Resident Evil)
  - Players cannot shoot and move at the same time (Resident Evil)
  - Players must see through a camera (Outlast)
- Make players worried about the future
- There shound't be a right answer in choice

## Level 3: Oppression

- Add constant pressure to the player
- Examples
  - A undefeatable enemy that stalks player (Resident Evil)
  - Make where it was safe no longer safe (Resident Evil)
  - Solve puzzles when attacked by enemies (Resident Evil)

## Level 4: Self Suggestion

Level 1-3 are all physical objects, which players can get used to. Player's
imaginations are the scariest

- Implementations
  - Music: sound is more uncertain than visual (Sound of tyrant's boots in
    Resident Evil)
  - Monsters climbing out of TV

# Monsters

## Disgusting

Disgusting monsters are very scary

## Information Overload

A short burst of information is very scary. Also known as jumpscare

- Used at the height of atmosphere

## Powerful

Powerful monsters (sometimes undefeatable monsters) give people pressure.

## Contrast

Monsters that at some point are "good" can be scary

- Deadspace 2

## Close Encounter

When players have close encounters with a monster (preferrably newly revealed),
even though the player is in safety, the player would still be terrfieid

- Creaks

# Atomsphere

## Contrast

A world where everything seems normal at first is scarier than a world where
everthing seems scary at first

## Hint but Not Show

When something is hinted but not shown, players will use their imaginations.
Players' imaginations can be very scary.

## Small Space

Elevators, narrow passages are very scary

## Abilities

Combat/Weapons are a source of safety for players.

- Weak/No weapons makes players scared; same with scarce ammos
- Complicated combat makes the players less scared

## Compromises

Making compromises make people worried
