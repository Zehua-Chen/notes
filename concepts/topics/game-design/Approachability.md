# General Gameplay <span id="general-gameplay">

There are six axioms of approachibility during gameplay

- **Familiar**: a new game is to players, the more connection they will have
  with the game, and the more comfortable they will have in the learning
  process.
- **Purpose**: helps player understands what they need to do and how they get
  there.
- **Clarity**
  - **Turn-scale**: clarity address the options available that will shape
    players' success
  - **Game-scale**: clarity is how well players understand their performance and
    what they can do in the future to improve their performance
- **Assurance** is affirming players that playing the board game is a good idea.
  Assurance can remove players' reservations
- **Parsimony** is the goal of making the game less cognitively-burdening to
  play. This can be done by removing excessive ideas, mechanics and components

## Assurance <span id="assurance" />

TODO:

# First-Time Experience <span id="firstime-interaction" />

- **Load time**:
  - Only load what's needed
  - Async loading
  - Use profiling tools
- **Downloading assets**:
  - Don't make the player wait
- **Registration**:
  - Bypass ID
  - Automate using Vendor ID
  - Explain benefits
  - Defer until needed
- **Avoid startup configuration**
- **Ask for rating**
  - Don't ask during the first play

## Background Transfers <span id="background-transfers" />

- Segment assets
  - Especially good for linear progression games

## Tutorials <span id="tutorials" />

- Teach by playing
- Show primary mechanic
- Introduce concepts one at a time
- Provide tip in context
- Give help along the way

# Learning Curve <span id="learning-curve" />

- **Transparency**: \textbf{Transparency} is how much the player can predict the
  future. \textbf{Opacity} is the opposite of transparency, how little the
  player can predict about the future. Transparency and opacity are not
  inherently good for approachability. Low transparency does not mean low
  clarity.
- **Iconography**: \textbf{Iconography} can make the game less
  cognitively-burdening to play, but it comes at the cost of approachability;
  there are a lot of icons to learn. However, sometimes making the learning
  phase harder can make gameplay smoother. Simple icons should be used for games
  that are intended to be picked up fast.
- **Encouraging**: optimization of scoring Board games that have straightforward
  checkpoints would have a more friendly learning curve. Players often enjoy the
  experience of optimization, therefore, games with checkpoints that
  \textbf{encourage optimization} is accepting of new players.
- **Navigation**: Board games should help players develop an intuition of what
  to do when faced with choices, i.e. have a good \textbf{navigation}. % skill
  progression and learning curve Ideal games should have a \textbf{learning
  curve}, where it is easy for beginners to pick up the game, and there are
  rooms for experts to further advance their skills. It is common for a game to
  contain randomization to increase replay value and to reward players who have
  developed the skills to adapt to the changing circumstances.
