# Overview

Designers should focus on play experience in the prototyping stage.

- During the prototyping process, questions, answers, changes, and tasks all
  need to be documented, so that we don't lose track of the process.
- Prototypes should be made quickly and designers should not form an emotional
  attachment to their designs.
- Each batch of changes to design should be minimum, as one change can deliver a
  huge impact on the experience.

# Prototypes

- The **paper prototype** tries to simulate what would be on-screen
- **Physical prototype** simulates the feel of the game.
- **Playable prototype** models core game activity and are usually the first
  digital prototype. The key of playable prototyping is to focus on design
  values rather than editing design values to improve the play experience.
- **Art and sound prototypes** are used to find art directions. It can be
  developed in parallel to a playable prototype.
- An **interface prototype** is used to validate the way players interact with
  the game, ex. controllers and UIs.
- **Code/tech prototype** is used to layout the technical infrastructure for
  more complete prototypes. Code prototype has two functions. First, answering
  if it is possible to implement a kind of gameplay. Second, developing core
  gameplay and make it feel right.
- **Core game prototypes** incorporate all core areas of a game. Additional core
  game prototype can be created once feedbacks are processed.
- The **complete game prototype** should be able to be played from start to
  finish. The complete game prototype does not need to be perfect; done in
  production.
