# Overview

A system is a combination of mechanics or system that **takes in input** and
**results in an output**

- System are similar to mechanics, but mechanics is sometimes similar
- All games use systems
- Examples
  - Gravity
- Well designed systems should help gamers achieve multiple tasks.
  - **Jedi Fallen Order**: checkpoint also boost health

# Constraints

Constraint restricts what players can do in the game while creating gameplay.
According to lusory attitude, so long as they have gameplay, players are not
against constraints. Well-done contraints make players happy.
