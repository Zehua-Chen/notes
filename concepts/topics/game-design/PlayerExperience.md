# Overview

Action theory describe the cycle that people went through after encountering a
situation: beliefs, reaction, desire, intention, action, repeat. Layers of
experience are what players went through when they play the games: sensory,
information, interaction frame and purpose.

- **Sensory**: Sensory refers to what's perceived by players' sensor organs.
- **Information**: Information refers to how players understand what they see.
  Reflexive attention is performed by brains automatically, Voluntary attention
  is performed by player's consciousness. Understanding attention help designers
  understand how players perceive information. Information space is the possible
  meanings players can derive. Imperfect information space is where players
  don't know everything and perfect information space is where the players knows
  everything. Asymmetric information space is where players have different
  information and symmetric information space is where players have the same
  inforamtion.
- **Interaction** Interaction refers to the understanding how pieces of
  information interact with each other. Affordance is the properties of objects
  that determine how they can be used. Perceptible affordance are obvious ways
  objects can be used. Hidden affordance are not-so-obvious ways objects can be
  used. Understanding affordance help designers understand how the players
  interact with the game. Crampton-Smithâ€™s five characteristics of well-done
  interactivity give five properties of a well-designed interaction: mental
  model (how the players think the game works), feedback (letting player knows
  they have done something right), consistency (the game should respond to
  players the same way if players interact wit hthe game the same way),
  intuitiveness, navigability (players understanding what they can do), failure
  (failure help players improve).
- **Frame** Frame refers to the life that players have outside of games; frame
  shapes the perception of players
- **Purpose** Purpose refers to player's own goals of playing the game, types of
  players and purpose: achievers, explorers, socializer, killers.
