\section{Triplanar Mapping}

Triplanar mapping takes a single UV image, but instead of applying it once,
the algorithm appleis it three times from x, y, z axis. In addition,
tiling is also applied. This results in absolutely no streching in any
axis.

This algorithm is typically used to UV wrap objects that are otherwise
impossible to do, like terrains, or build grids.
