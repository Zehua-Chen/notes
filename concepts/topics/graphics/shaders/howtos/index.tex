\chapter{Howtos}

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Grid}: triplanar mapping (so that when the object is scaled,
  the texture won't be strecthed)
  \item \textbf{Custom texture colors}: use a black and white texture, and two
  colors. The whiteness serves as the time input to linear interpolation and
  the two colors are the start and end colors to linear interpolation.\
  \item \textbf{Glowing Effects}: use Fresnel node and HDR color space
  \begin{itemize}
    \item HDR color space can give colors that are much bighter than other RGB
    color spaces
    \item The output of Fresnel node don't have to be connected to emission.
  \end{itemize}

  \item \textbf{Toon/Cel Shading}
  \begin{enumerate}
