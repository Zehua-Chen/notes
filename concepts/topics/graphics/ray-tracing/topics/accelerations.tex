\section{Data Structures}

  Building these structures can be expensive, but is relatively cheap
  comparing to the tracing operation.

  \begin{itemize}
    \item Regular Grids
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Poor performance for non-uniform complexity in the scene
      \item Cannot nest grid in a grid structure
    \end{itemize}

    \item \acrfull{bvh}
    \item Regular grids and BVH tree are faster to construct than other choices
  \end{itemize}

  \subsection{Axis Aligned Bounding Boxes (AABB)}

    \begin{align}
      p_{0} &= \left( x_{0}, y_{0}, z_{0} \right) \\
      p_{1} &= \left( x_{1}, y_{1}, z_{1} \right)
    \end{align}

    \begin{itemize}
      \item $ p_{0} $ is the min point; $ p_{1} $ is the max point
      \item Fast to test
      \item Can be used as a quick rejection test
    \end{itemize}
