\section{Texture Filtering}

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Magnification}: more fragments than texels
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Nearest neighbor interpolation
    \item Bilinear interpolation
  \end{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Minification}: more texels than fragments
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Mipmapping}

  A method of pre-filtering a texture for minification

  \begin{itemize}
    \item Generate a pyramid of textures: bottom level is the original
    texture and each subsequent layer reduces the resolution
    by $ \frac{1}{4} $
    \item Computing filterings during runtime is too expensive
  \end{itemize}
