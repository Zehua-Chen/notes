# Overview

Gestalt means shape. Gestalt principles help you group shapes into a group

# Principle 1 - Proximity

Shapes closer to each other will appear in a group

# Principle 2 - Similarity

Similar shapes will appear in a group

- Colors, size are easy to scan for
- Shapes are hard to scan for

# Principle 3 - Enclosure

Shapes appearing in an enclosure will appear to be in a group

# Principle 4 - Symmetry

```
[ ]( ){ }
```

Symmetrical objects (`[ ]`) will appear in a group

# Principle 5 - Closure

> The principle of closure states that when we look at a complex arrangement of
> visual elements, we tend to look for a single, recognizable pattern.
>
> In other words, when you see an image that has missing parts, your brain will
> fill in the blanks and make a complete image so you can still recognize the
> pattern

# Principle 6 - Continuity

> The principle of continuity states that elements that are arranged on a line
> or curve are perceived to be more related than elements not on the line or
> curve.

# Principle 7 - Connectivity

Shapes connected by other shapes will appear in a group

# Principle 8 - Figure and Ground

> Elements are perceived as either figures (distinct elements of focus) or
> ground (the background or landscape on which the figures rest).
