\chapter{Hardware}

Hardwares in VR are split into the following categories

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Display}: a way to generate stimuli for sense organs
  (ex. screens, speakers, haptic feedback)
  \item \textbf{Sensors}: devices that extracts information from the real world
  The \textbf{positions and orientations} of sense organs must be tracked to
  adapt the stimulus
  \item \textbf{Computers} where the VWG is executed
\end{itemize}

\section{Display}

  \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Virtual World Generator (VWG)}: something that generates the
    virtual world
    \item \textbf{Rendering}: the process of send info from VWG onto the
    display
    \item Types of aural \& visual displays
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \textbf{User-fixed}
      \item \textbf{World-fixed}
    \end{itemize}

    The two systems differ in the following areas
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Volume
      \item Power consumption
      \item Privacy
      \item Comfort
      \item Sharing
      \item Costs
      \item Ways they adapt to actions
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}

\section{Sensors}

  \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Transducer}: converts energy from one form to another
    \item \textbf{Sensor}: converts energy to signals for electrical circuit
    \item Sensors typically have a \textbf{receptor} that collects energies
    \item \textbf{Sense organs} convert energy to neural impulses
    \item Each sense organ has a \textbf{configuration space}, which represents
    all the ways in which it can be transformed or configured; the most
    important aspect is the degree of freedom, \textbf{DOF}
    \item A rigid body has 6 DOFs
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item Side to side motion
      \item Vertical motion
      \item Closer-further motion
      \item Yaw
      \item Pict
      \item Roll
    \end{enumerate}

    \item Inertial Measurement Unit \textbf{IMU} captures orientations
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \textbf{Gyroscope}: measures angular velocity
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Modern hardware uses MEMS-based gyroscopes that measure the
        effect of rotation on a vibrating object
      \end{itemize}

      \item \textbf{Accelerometer}: measures acceleration
      \item \textbf{Magnetometer}: measures the direction of a magnetic field
    \end{itemize}

    \item Cameras can also capture inforation from the environment
    (ex. hand, arms, bodies, ...)
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \textbf{Depth camera} projects light and observes reflection
      \item \textbf{Optical mouse}
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}

\section{Computers}

  \begin{itemize}
    \item Microcontrollers can be used to gather info from sensors and
    send them to the main computer
  \end{itemize}
