\section{Behavior}

There are three ways to describe light

\begin{itemize}
  \item Photons
  \item \textbf{Waves}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Density of waves decrease as light move away from the source
    \item Different wavelengths give differnet colors; only some colors
    are visible to humans
    \item Light sources typically do not emit \textbf{coherent light}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Different wave length with peaks aligned differently
      \item Only exception is laser
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}

  \item Rays
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Light rays always diverge; they only converge with the prescense
    of lenses or mirrors
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Interaction with Materials}

  Typically all three interactions appear at the same time, the amount of
  energy in different interactions maybe different depending on

  \begin{itemize}
    \item Angle of approach
    \item Wave length
    \item Difference between two adjacent materials
  \end{itemize}

  \subsubsection{Transmission}

    Rays come in from one side and come out from the other side

    \begin{itemize}
      \item \textbf{Transparent material}: rays would be slowed down and bend
      according to \textbf{Snell's Law}
      \item \textbf{Translucent material}: rays would scatter before exiting
    \end{itemize}

  \subsubsection{Absorption}

    Light would be trapped into the material

  \subsubsection{Reflection}

    Light would be deflected from the surface

    \begin{itemize}
      \item \textbf{Specular reflection}: entry angle would be \textbf{equal to
      exit angle}
      \item \textbf{Diffuse reflection}: light would deflect into arbitrary
      directions
      \item Wavelengths reflected from surfaces would be different depending on
      the material, thus assigning the surfaces colors
      \begin{itemize}
        \item White surfaces reflect all wavelengths
        \item Blue surfaces reflect blue wavelengths
        \item Dark surfaces reflect few wavelengths
      \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
