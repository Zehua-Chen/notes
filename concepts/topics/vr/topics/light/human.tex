\section{Human Eye}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Focal plane of a lens is replaced with the \textbf{retian}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Sphereically curved
    \item \textbf{Photoreceptors} convert light into neural signals
  \end{itemize}

  \item Eyes contain liquid rather than air
  \item Made of two convex lenses, one of $ 40 D $, the other of $ 20 D $
  \item Eyes can change the focal length
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Children can increase diopters by $ 15-20 $
    \item Young adults can do $ 10 D $
    \item People over 50 has little accomodation abilities
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Vision Abnormalities}

  \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Farsightedness}: eyes don't have the power to converge rays
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Fixable using convex lens (positive diopter)
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Nearsightedness}: eyes have too much power so that it can't
    see far objects clearly
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Fixable using concave lens (negative diopter)
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Astigmatism}: caused by eyes being elliptical, rather than
    radially symmetric

    \item Different eyes may have different issues
    \item Other aberrations also occur, but are fixed by the brain
  \end{itemize}

\subsection{Simple VR Headset}

  \begin{itemize}
    \item Use convex lenses to increase optical power
    \item Lens placed at the focal distance
    \begin{align}
      s_{2} &= -f \\
      s_{1} &= \infty
    \end{align}

    The screen would appear as a enormous virtual image that is infinitely
    far away

    \item Lens should have focusing knobs to adjust the distance between
    the lens and the screen
    \item If someone has astigmatism, then placing glasses inside the headset
    is the only solution
    \item \textbf{IPD}, interpupillary distance should be $ 55-75mm $ to center
    the images for everyone
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Average is $ 64mm $
    \end{itemize}

    \item Eyes can rotate
    \item \textbf{DPI} (dots per inch) needs to get to a certain value so that
    the eyes cannot see the pixels
  \end{itemize}
