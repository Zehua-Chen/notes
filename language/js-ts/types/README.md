# Communicate Intensions

## Null

Don't use null. Null can be very confusing. Use a type to indicate error
instead. [(Communicating Intention with Functional TypeScript by Thiago

## Any, Unknown

Unknown means the signature might change in the future. Any means that the
function can handle any type [(Communicating Intention with Functional
TypeScript by Thiago Temple)][1]

## Immutable

- `readonly`

[(Communicating Intention with Functional TypeScript by Thiago Temple)][1]

## Make Invalid State Impossible to Represent

As title [(Communicating Intention with Functional TypeScript by Thiago
