      \item Discoveries: 支持
      \item Creation: 不支持, 只有一部分发明是偶然的
    \end{itemize}

    \subsection{支持: Discoveries}

      \begin{itemize}
        \item The very existence of a potential discovery is by its nature
        unknown to man, so we would not think of discovering something
        that is not in our mind. The face has always been that our ancestors
        and great minds in history discovered something extraordinary
        while they were striving to discover or create something else.
        Discoveries, therefore, have been and will still be fortuitous

          \item Alexander Fleming \& Penicillin
          \item Christopher Columbus \& the New World
          \item Archeological discoveries such as the Peking Man

      \end{itemize}

        bumbped into inventing something unexpected while seeking to achieve
        another end

          \end{itemize}
        \end{itemize}

        \item However, most creations are the result of human ingenuity,
        curiosity, perseverance, and, most important of all, desires.
        Ma gets his job done invariably when to comes to creating something
        out of thin air
        \begin{itemize}
          \item Constitutionalism: start with Magna Carta, the US Constitution

          \item The Sharing Economy: Airbnb
          \item Calculus: Newton and Leibniz; 微积分的发现不是偶然现象, 随着科学
          的发展, 新事物必然发现;
          \item Tesla
          \item Archimedes:
          \item Religions of the World: 宗教必然被发明, 因为要满足人们的精神需要,
          解释世界, 和统治人民
          \item Birth of Jazz: 美国黑人发明, 做为音乐快销品 (留声机发明时, 音乐很长,
          需要短的)
          \item K12: 普鲁士提高士兵素质所创造的体制
        \end{itemize}
      \end{itemize}

    \subsection{当目的题}

      \begin{itemize}
        \item A+ to B+: As many people come across answers to questions that
        are not their targets, discoveries and creation came into being
        \item A- to B-: there are still many times people achieve their
        intended goal
        \item A+ to B-: the achievements of some great individuals seem to be
        serendipitou, but in fact inevitable. Those with wisdom and passion
        are already on their way to glorty; they just need an opportunity
      \end{itemize}
