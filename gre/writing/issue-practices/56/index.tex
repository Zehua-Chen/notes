  \section{Outline}

    \subsection{赞同: 有效}

      \begin{itemize}
        \item For art works whose primary purpose is to promulgate universal
        values, values cultures from all over the world all cherish,
        understandibility is a necessity
        \begin{itemize}
          \item Movies that achieved the highest box office record
          \begin{itemize}
            \item Avatar: benevolence, environment and peace
            \item Gone With the Wind: Tomorrow is another day
          \end{itemize}

          \item Movies received the highest raitings:
          \begin{itemize}
            \item The Shawshank Redemption: fear can hold you prisoner, hope
            can set you free
          \end{itemize}
        \end{itemize}
      \end{itemize}

    \subsection{反对: 不可行}

      \begin{itemize}
        \item Truly great works of art are intrinsically hard to understand,
        it takes an inborn sense of esthetics or profiessional training to
        genuinely appreciate them
        \begin{itemize}
          \item Stream of consciousness writing (hard to understand):
          Ulysses by James Joyce
          \item Ezra Pound's poem: In a station of the metro
          (hard to understand, but beautiful to trained readers)
          \item Impressionist Musician: Claude Debussy and Maurice Ravel
          (beautiful only to trained ears)
          \item Salvador Dali: The Persistence of Memory (hard to understand)
          \item Piet Mondrian: wierd trees
          \item Louis Wain: wierd cats
        \end{itemize}
      \end{itemize}

    \subsection{反对: 副作用}

      \begin{itemize}
        \item Intentionally creating works that are easily understandable,
        artists are in fact pandering to the taste of the general public,
        which, more often than not, is not artistically commendable
        \begin{itemize}
          \item Popular culture: don't last long (Katy Perry's songs), some
          are even \textbf{low-brow}
        \end{itemize}
      \end{itemize}

    \subsection{反对: 其他方案}

      \begin{itemize}
        \item How is the merit of an artwork defined? Can't a person simply
        enjoy a piece of art without understanding either its intended
        meaning or professional techniques? Is the quality of providing
        a moment of enjoyment not considered merit?
        \begin{itemize}
          \item Nirvana: 表达当代年轻人, 作者的情感, 但是大部分人听不出来
          \begin{itemize}
            \item Kurt Cobain: Lithium
          \end{itemize}
        \end{itemize}
      \end{itemize}
