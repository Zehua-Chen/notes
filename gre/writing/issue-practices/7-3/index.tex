  \section{Outline}

    \subsection{支持: A+ to B+}

      \begin{itemize}
        \item Human's disrutpion of ecosystem and thereby of biodiversity can
        set into motion a series of extinctions taht ultimately might endanger
        our own survival as a species
        \begin{itemize}
          \item Pangolin (穿山甲): 穿山甲数量下降, 导致白蚁数量上升, 破坏森林, 伤害
          \say{other species of flora and fauna}, 伤害\say{ecosystem}
          \item Dodo: 西方殖民者把Dudo赶尽杀绝, Dodo是\say{important disperser of
          seeds}; their loss has permanently affected forest structure in their
          habitats
          \item Amazon forest: half of hte planet's remaining forests, and
          comprises the largest most biodiverse tract of tropical rainforest, with
          an estimated 390 billion individual trees divided into 16000 species
          \begin{itemize}
            \item Purification of our wastes, production of harvestable resources,
            regularization of our climate
          \end{itemize}
        \end{itemize}

        \item 通过讨论人类导致物种灭绝的手段, 得出人类需要保护物种之理由
        \begin{itemize}
          \item Pollution: the introduction of cantaminants into the natural
          environment that cause adverse change; ex. yangtze river dolphin
          \item Exploitation of natural resources: the use of natural resources
          for economic growth, sometimes with a negative connotation of
          accompanying environmented degradation
          \item The introduction of harmful exotic and nonnative organisms
          \item The spread of diseases
        \end{itemize}
      \end{itemize}

    \subsection{支持: A- to B-}

      \begin{itemize}
        \item Humans ought not ot interfere with natural selection; it can
        be a complete waste of resources of human society to save those species
        having gone down an evolutionary dead end
        \begin{itemize}
          \item Giant Panda should be allowed to diet out - The Daily Telegraph
        \end{itemize}
      \end{itemize}

    \subsection{反对: A+ to B-}

      \begin{itemize}
        \item Human beings as a species have their own will to live and
        reproduce at hte cost of the wellbeing of other species
        \begin{itemize}
          \item Richard Dawkins - The Selfish Gene: this might sound crule,
          but according to the selfish gene theory, humans themselves cannot
          inhibit their own desire to combat for habitats and resources more
          than dinosaurs did, they very species taht once dominated Earth and
          did not give a chance to mammals
        \end{itemize}

        \item Certain species, pests for example, are too aggressive, and
        therefore, their population needs to be controlled, if not
        exterminated
      \end{itemize}

    \subsection{反对: A- to B+}

      \begin{itemize}
        \item Many rare species are of great
        \begin{enumerate}
          \item scientific values: more than a quarter of all prescriptions
          written annually in the Untied States contain chemicals discovered
          in plants and animals: antibiotics, anti-cancer agents, pain killers,
          and blood thinners
          \item Esthetic values: pandas
          \item Economic values: pandas can produce esthetic values, zoos
          (more in Economic Naturalists)
          \begin{itemize}
            \item The US Fish and wildlife service estiamted that wildlife
            watching generated 85 billions in economic benefits to the
            nation in 2001
          \end{itemize}
        \end{enumerate}
      \end{itemize}
