  \section{Need Evidence For}

    \paragraph{Need Evidence For 1} The geological past of the region in which
    the prehistoric village of Palea is located might have to be first
    evidence needed to evaluate this argument.

    It is a common sensical fact that the geographic landform of a region
    changes with the passage of time.

    \paragraph{Need Evidence For 2} Another piece of evidence that might help
    up evaluate this argument is concerned with the possible ways in which
    ancient Paleans got themselves across The Brim River.

    If we have evidence that the village of Palean went through a period of
    little ice age then crossing the river by walking is not inconceivable.

    \paragraph{Need Evidence For 3} To fully evaluate this argument, it is also
    important for one to understand that the loss of archeological evidence,
    especially pieces from prehistoric times, is not uncommon.
