  \section{Need Evidence For}

    \begin{itemize}
      \item \say{most of the complaints}: Incomplete data, a lack of control group
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Sample size
        \item Size compared to previous years
      \end{itemize}

      For an effective evaluation of the argument, we need as evidence a
      complete set of data concerning the number and seriousness of
      complaints before and after the new policy

      \item \say{most of the complaints}: National news up; weather \&
      local news down; -> complains
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Point out the lack of experiement or survey: call back, survey
        \item Offer alternative explanation: weather is inaccurate
      \end{itemize}

      We might also need evidence about what exactly the viewers are
      complaining about.

      \item \say{local business that}: national news up; weather \& local news
      down -> cancellation
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Point out the lack of experiement or survey
        \item Offer alternative explanation: expensive, change of tactics?
      \end{itemize}

      Evidence concerning why the local business cancelled their contracts
      would also be interesting

      \item \textbf{Last resort, nessicity}, \say{we should restore}: the old
      way may produce the expected outcome
      \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Solution}: come up with new programs
      \end{itemize}

      The last but definitely not the least piece of evidence needed to fully
      evaluate this article has something to do with general trend in the
      preferences of today's TV viewers
    \end{itemize}
