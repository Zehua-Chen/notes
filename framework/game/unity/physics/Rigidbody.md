# Properties

- Interpolate:
  - `Interpolate`: creates smooth movement, but lags a bit
  - `Extrapolate`: used for faster movements, but not as smooth
- `useGravity`: if true the object would have a gravity force applied on it
- `centerOfMass`: center of mass of the rigidbody
  - By default, it is the center point of all colliders (including those in
    children)
