# `pipe(fds)`

## `pipe2(fds, flags)`

Same to `pipe`, but can take optional flags:

- `O_CLOEXEC`: when a process is cloned, all of its file descriptors are also
  cloned; this flag would close all file descriptors inherited **atomically**
  from a parent process upon `exec` **if they are not already closed**.
