```c
exec(path, ...)
```

Replace the current process image with a new process image created from the
executable file created from `path`

## Memory

Previous **allocated heap memory will not be considered as leak, even though
they are not deallocated**, as the current memory image is part of the current
system image, which is replaced during `exec`.
