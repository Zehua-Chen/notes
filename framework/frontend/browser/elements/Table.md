# Borders

Borders in tables are mostly the same as in other elements

## `border-collapse`

`border-collapse` controls the spacing between the borders between rows

- `separate`: each row has its own border, i.e. look like there is spacing
- `collapse`: all rows share border, i.e. look like there is no spacing
