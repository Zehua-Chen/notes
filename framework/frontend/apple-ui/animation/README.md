# Animation

There are two types of animation on Apple platforms

- **Implicit Animation**: animations are triggered when properties are set in
  the "right context"
  - Disabled by default on all platforms
- **Explicit Animation**: animations are triggered by creating animations
  objects explicitly and adding those animations to views or layers
